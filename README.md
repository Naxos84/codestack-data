# ðŸ¤“ CodeStack Data

**How do I add myself?**

1. Fork this Repo
1. Go to `/data/users.json`
1. Don't add yourself right at the beginning of the file
1. Add yourself randomly in the middle of the file
1. The format should be:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "telmo",
      "stack": [
        "React",
        "GraphQL",
        "MySQL",
        "Rails",
        "Next.js"
      ],
      "setup": [
        "Google Chrome",
        "Apple"
      ]
   }
   ```

1. | Field        | Description           | Type  |
   | ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
   | `username`      | Your Twitter Handler | `string` |
   | `stack`      | List of Stacks      |   `array` |
   | `setup` | Browser, Machine, etc      |  `array` |

   > For `stack` and `setup`, check [SimpleIcons](https://simpleicons.org) for the correct name, it needs to match the name on **SimpleIcons**, it's case sensitive.
